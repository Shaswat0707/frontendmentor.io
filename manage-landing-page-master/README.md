## Overview

This is a challenge from [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa/hub)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

I first completed the mobile view and then switched to the desktop view. This process has helped me a lot because it is much easier to align div according to the desktop view. I use desktop view for some design references but I completed my mobile view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Accessible hiding and aria-hidden example](https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/articles/accessible-hiding/) - The conventional way is to use CSS (display:none; and visibility:hidden;) or the HTML5 `hidden` attribute. These properties hide elements not only on the screen, but also for screen reader users. Thus, these elements will not be visible nor vocalized by Assistive technologies.
